## Research Interest - Computer Architecture

Computer Architecture is a subset of general computer science that focuses on the organisation of components that make up a computer system. It deals with processors which are often overlooked by us due to the abstractions that we use. One can say computer architecture can be broadly divided into two sections:
1. Performance
2. Security

Performance side of computer architecture deals with optimising processors for more and more computing speeds. While security side deals with making processsors secure from attacks.
