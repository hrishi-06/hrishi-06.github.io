## Spring 2023
[**Spectre Attack without Shared Memory**](./spring-2023/unshared-spectre/)
- We extended existing code for spectre attack with shared memory by splitting attacker and victim into different processes
- Prime and Probe was used to implement spectre attack without any shared memory between attacker and victim

[**SigmaZero - RL based Chess Engine**](./spring-2023/sigmazero/)
- We implemented a chess engine inspired from AlphaZero
- Used C++ backend interfaced with Python for Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm
