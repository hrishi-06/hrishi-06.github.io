## Football

I love watching and playing football. I support Manchester City FC, Kevin De bruyne being my favorite player. Most memorable football moment - when City won the treble. We can talk for hours if the subject of discussion is football :)

## Formula 1

I also love watching Formula 1. No, it's not cars driving around in circles. There's so much technicality involved, you don't appreciate it until you get to know all of it. I support Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing Team.
